This is one of the most highly rec’d Drarry fics ever, it’s terribly well written and characterised and there’s a lot of complex magic introduced around sigils. I just felt like the main plot line didn’t feel like grounds for a whole novel as it’s basically just cleaning up after You-Know-Who and Lucius. Worth a read but not an all time fave for myself. Plus it needs more sex :)
