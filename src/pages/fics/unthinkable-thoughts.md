I really enjoyed the early part of the story but as the fic settled down it got into the hospital wing slump that happens in Gold-Tinted Spectacles and Bond that doesn’t tickle my fancy. It ends just before the inevitable clash with Voldemort which is fairly fitting given the nature of the fic but it’s disappointing there isn’t a sequel where that plot is tackled.
