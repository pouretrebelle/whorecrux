SO almost all the canon stuff that happens in 6th year takes place between the prequel and this fic, which makes it an alternate telling of Deathly Hallows (think horcrux hunting, soul splitting ect.) but with Sentinel and Shaman abilities, and an expanded cast. Some things you knew had to happen actually were serialised very differently. Not the best or most engaging writing in the world, but I loved the journey.
