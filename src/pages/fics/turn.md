Wow what a specific summary ^^. Set in 2017, Harry and Ginny are settled into their married life with the kids when Harry meets an old man and wakes up the next day in a different universe - how his life would have played out had he endeavoured to help Draco in sixth year. A lot of things are different, but mostly for the better.

Quite an enigma. A lot is superfluous storytelling and there are parts that feel so non-canon and original they lose the familiarity that you get from fanfiction, but paints a very complete and enticing picture, worth a read if you can spare several days.
