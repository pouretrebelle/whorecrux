Warning - this fic is abandoned and ends abruptly and unresolved (i.e. no happy ending)

This fic is Drarry royalty, one of the very first and forms the first half of ship name “guns and handcuffs”. Revolving around Gangster!Harry and PartnerInCrime!(and sluty to boot)Draco half a decade after they were forced to leave Hogwarts when caught in bed together. Harry’s now one of the biggest crime bosses of London but he’s very confused and vulnerable when he gets dragged back into the magical world and struggles to make peace with everyone who betrayed him all those years ago.
