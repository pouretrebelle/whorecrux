One of my first long drarry fics. It’s an alternative to deathly hallows and is just incredible in mass; not the traditional magical world you know and love, this guides through Durmstrang and its sister school Magisch Schön, rebuilding Godric’s Hollow and some crazy horcrux-searching. The beginning drags a lot, there’s a good 40k words before we even meet Draco, taken up by Ginny, and then there’s some weird destiny symbolic crap but it eventually develops into pure fantasy.
