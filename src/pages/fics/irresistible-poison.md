The handcuffs part of S.S. Guns & Handcuffs. So Draco accidentally brews a love potion and Harry’s taking a midnight walk at just the wrong moment. Reality blurs for both of them as they endevour to counteract the potion before anyone finds out. This was a really enjoyable fic with humour, angst, magic, romance and confusion..
