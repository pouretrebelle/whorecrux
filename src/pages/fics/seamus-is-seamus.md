And by ’changes’ the author means he gets super super smoking hot. Everybody wants a piece of him; all the girls, all the boys, even the teachers and especially Seamus Finnigan. Draco Malfoy feels the need to protect Harry’s innocence.

This is so funny. At times I cackled out loud. It’s sort of unbelievable how extreme this whole ‘everyone wants Harry’ thing gets but it’s so funny it totally works.
