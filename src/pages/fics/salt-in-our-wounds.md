Four years have passed since Harry Potter escaped from the dungeons of the Manor, and Draco Malfoy’s life has been shattered to pieces. Two haunted young men are brought together by the twists of fate.

In an ironic turn of events, Harry saves Draco from the Malfoy dungeons, and proceeds to volunteer to house Draco during his MoM-ordered probation period. Mostly taking place in Harry’s muggle house in Bristol; it’s sweet, heart-wrenching, and totally gratifying.
