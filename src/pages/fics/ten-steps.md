Harry can’t get a date, until Professor Amour, aka Draco Malfoy, starts teaching him to court one Oliver Wood. Things get complicated. I like this a lot apart from I feel like it didn’t maturely display ‘relationships’, like if you go on one or two dates with somebody you’re not suddenly boyfriend and boyfriend for life. MatchMaker!Draco was great though.
