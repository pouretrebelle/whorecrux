So something dodgy’s going on in the settlement of the Malfoy inheritance. Snape (whom I absolutely adore in this world) and Hermione team up, Harry gets some information of his own and Draco’s caught between a rock and a hard place.

For me it’s a bit too mysterious and there isn’t enough magic, although it is very well written and a satisfying accompaniment to ATBT.
