When Harry Potter bonds with his soulmate (spoiler alert: it’s Draco Malfoy) his as-yet-unknown Hecatemus powers come out. Hecatema are connected with the world around them - they can sense human emotions and magical energy and most importantly their partners. Harry and Draco have to overcome a lot.
