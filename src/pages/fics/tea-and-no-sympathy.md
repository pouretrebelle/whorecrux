summary: 'It’s Potter’s fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It’s been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco’s getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he’s falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?'

Love the writing in this. Draco is the perfect Draco, unabashedly rude by design, but blunt, self-assured, with depth and critical integrity. I was a little tired by the first few chapters where Draco was trying to perfect the same day, but it got really interesting when he started mixing it up, going to different places and seeing different people. A slew of alternate realities, all intriguing in their own way. It all comes together perfectly but I’d kill for an epilogue!
