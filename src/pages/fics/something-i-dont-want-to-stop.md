It’s Harry and Draco’s eighth year, the Houses have been all but demolished in favor of unity, and they’re being forced to room together. How ever will they cope?

Oh the tropes. I love the tropes. Started this in the bath. Sat in bath for 2 hours to finish it. Very fulfilling if you want something short and easy.
