It’s a very hard story to tag because it literally has everything. It (chronologically) begins when Draco decides to become a spy for the Order after being shocked by the cruelness of his father and undergoes intense training with Snape. Within the first three chapters of nine the war is over and everyone’s licking their wounds, including two of the story’s main characters Dean and Seamus. The main plot revolves around Draco taking on a vow of silence, and not for the reasons the Wizarding World believe.

There’s something for everyone but not everything for someone, I particularly liked chapters two and seven.
